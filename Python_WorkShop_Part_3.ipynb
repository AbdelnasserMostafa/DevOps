Finally, use the object returned from the parser object in your script to access the values supplied in the arguments.

For a long-running process, a JIT compiler can try different strategies to compile the same code and find the ones that work best in the program's environment. The program will quickly get faster until the best version the compiler can find is running. Take a look at PyPy in the following exercise.\n",

    "cProfile is a module that builds an execution profile of your code. Every time your Python program enters or exits a function or other callable, cProfile records what it is and how long it takes. It's then up to you to work out how it could spend less time doing that. Remember to compare a profile recorded before your change with one recorded after, to make sure you improved things! As you'll see in the next exercise, not all \"optimizations\" actually make your code faster, and careful measurement and thought are needed to decide whether the optimization is worth pursuing and retaining. In practice, cProfile is often used when trying to understand why code is taking longer than expected to execute. For example, you might write an iterative calculation that suddenly takes 10 minutes to compute after scaling to 1,000 iterations. With cProfile, you might discover that this is due to some inefficient function in the pandas library, which you could potentially avoid to speed up your code.\n",
