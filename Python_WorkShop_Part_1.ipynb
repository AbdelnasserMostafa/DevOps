Computers are very fast, and the difference between performing 10 iterations in a loop and 1,000 iterations may seem immaterial to us. However, algorithms can quickly become inefficient as the problem grows. In measuring complexity, you are interested in knowing the time it takes to execute the algorithm changes as the size of the problem changes. If the problem is 10 times as large, does the algorithm take 10 times as long to execute, 100 times as long, or 1010 times as long? This relationship between the size of the problem and the steps taken is called the time complexity of an algorithm."
