TroubleShooting : Create our First Maven-based Jenkins Job
If you got the below errors while putting the Github URL on Jenkins:

Failed to connect to repository : Error performing command: C:\Git\bin ls-remote -h https://github.com/anshulc55/Jenkins_Upgradev3.git HEAD

or

Failed to connect to repository : Error performing command: C:\Users\mks7kor\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\cmd ls-remote -h https://github.com/anshulc55/Jenkins_Upgradev3.git HEAD

Solution:

Step 1: Find out where GIT is installed on your laptop (For Linux/Mac Users, you can run which git to find out the full path of GIT),

Step 2: In the Path to Git executable field on the below Global Tool Configuration section put the full path to GIT.

If you are using Windows, you might need to add exe extension to the end of git as well ( use git.exe instead of git )




If Build is Failing:
In case you run into the following error when build your first Jenkins job

FATAL: Couldn't find any executable in /Users/xxxxx/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9Build step 'Invoke top-level Maven targets' marked build as failureFinished: FAILURE
it means jenkins user doesn't have permissions to access your maven directory. (Jenkins by default will run all builds under a special user name called jenkins )



Solution:

To fix it, we need to ensure that jenkins user has read and executable permission on /**/**apache-maven-** folder.



For Mac/Linux User:

If Maven is installed on /Users/anshul/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9

Step1 : under your regular user ID, run the following command:

chmod 0755 /Users/anshul/Documents

to ensure that jenkins user can access /Users/anshul/Documents

Step 2: run the following command:

chmod -R 0755 /Users/anshul/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9

to ensure jenkins can access to all the files under /Users/Hossein/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9

Step 3: verify jenkins user can run the maven mvn command:

switch under jenkins user by running sudo -iu jenkins

then run /Users/anshul/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/mvn -v to verify you can execute mvn under jenkins user



For Windows User:

If you are using Windows, the troubleshooting steps should be very similar to Mac/Linux, you can change the permission by right-clicking the folder name.
